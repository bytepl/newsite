My name is Maciej. Maciej Chojnacki.

I am an IT engineer living and working in Wrocław, Poland. I deal with [Windows Server OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server), [Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure) and [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) - but I am not your regular Windows admin, I believe. Although I work with Microsoft technologies daily, I do not own a Windows machine. I have been using non-Windows OSes for many years now, starting with Linux[^1] and finally settling on MacOS. My main machine is a Mac mini and I use Macbook Air when I prefer to do things from my couch. Now that Powershell is platform agnostic, you do not need a Windows client machine anymore. I do appreciate that because, let's face it, Windows is not yet ready for the desktop.

When I am not working, I like to read some books, with two main areas of interest being astrophysics and history (particularly, Third Reich). Yeah, I know, it's weird.
